##Pomodoro timer created to require little user interaction

# To-do:
# Create GUI with tkinter

# Define function passed the type of time to be set
def set_time(timeType):
    # Loop trying to return input
    while True:
        try:
            # Get integer input from user for the specific time type
            return int(input('Enter ' + timeType + ' time in seconds as an integer: '))
        # Print error if input isn't an int and return to getting integer input
        except: #ValueError:
            print('Invalid input')
            continue

# Define function passed state and times
def time_up(isWorking, breakTime, workTime):

# Tell the user how to exit the program during operation

        print(counter)
        time.sleep(1)
        counter -= 1
